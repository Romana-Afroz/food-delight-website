        <h2 class="align">Our Service</h2>
        <p class="brg">Flagship food services, from fast food restaurants to fine dining establishments, fall into the most recognizable and widespread of food service categories: commercial food services. Also referred to as "market-oriented food services", this category accounts for the lion's share of consumer spending on food and beverage products outside of the home. An entire spectrum of segments from food trucks to nightclubs fall into this category. Below is a breakdown of defining characteristics that set commercial food services apart from their non-commercial counterparts followed by an overview of the respective types. </p>
